          <p>We are sharing our service roadmap as part of a concerted e ort to engage with B.C.’s tech community,
            and to enable them to help shape, re ne and contribute to the development of the BCDevExchange.
          </p>

          <p>Early on, B.C.'s tech community told us we should build the BCDevExchange in collaboration; advice we have taken to heart.</p>

          <p>From the beginning, we published the open source code that powers the BCDevExchange app in
            GitHub, the popular online code sharing platform, and worked to openly share a growing number
            of digital resources, including APIs, code and data.</p>

          <p>We are partnering with the developers, app builders, start-ups and public sector innovators;
            those who we want as users of the BCDevExchange.</p>

          <p>We invite you to see what we are doing, and we welcome your advice and contributions on
            how to evolve the BCDevExchange.</p>


          <p>Where did the roadmap come from?</p>

          <p>The BCDevExchange team is treating this initiative as a type of "lean start-up" e ort,
            with a customer-centered service design and an Agile methodology. We build, test and
            re ne based on our user’s feedback to ensure we deliver value to them.</p>

          <p>The roadmap was derived through work we did with our community last year, and may change based on further feedback from our community.</p>

          <p>To create the roadmap, we  rst examined our research  ndings on common business needs in the
             community. We then determined how we could meet those business needs with a range of services
             that you will  nd in this roadmap.</p>

          <p>We realized that business needs could be grouped into cultural, process and technological
            transformations with the objectives of accelerating the speed of delivering value and
            increasing code quality.</p>


          <p>  HOW TO USE THIS ROADMAP</p>

          <p>In broad terms, this roadmap describes the potential services of the BCDevExchange.
          These are the Epics – our big pieces of work. Each Epic has a high-level user story and
          the stages we will follow, beginning with customer discovery and user research.</p>

          <p>For more detail, each Epic is broken down into smaller user stories which can be viewed
          and commented on in our Kanban boards. At the smaller user story level, you can  nd and
          explore the tasks and associated artifacts related to each story.</p>

          <p>These Kanban boards organize our user stories into three groups. Using Agile parlance we
          have our product backlog, work currently underway during our current two-week development
          sprint, and completed work.</p>
