## Approach

First part of the project will be to work on the html5 mark-up using the mock ups as reference and starting with the common elements:

- Header
- Footer

Then  the mark-up for:
- main content on the homepage (`index.html`)
- main content on content page (`roadmap.html`)
- main content program lists page (`programs-list.html`)
- main program details page (`program.html`)

All styles will be using the BEM (block element modifier) notation with the prefix 'bcde-' to clearly identify any new styles that go on top of what bootstrap is providing.

Once reviewed and finalized what the desktop and mobile versions of the components within the 4  pages above, we will proceed to generate a styleguide with all the different components and layouts:

- directory of components and layouts (`styleguide.html`)

In the end, on top of the 5 .html files mentioned above, I will also deliver:
- `bcdevexchange-theme.css` file with the layers of styles needed to 'BC Developers' Exchangify' (aka customize) the html5 markup
- `behaviour.js` with any javascript needed to enhance the deliverables.
- assets like logos and images optimized/enhanced to be rendered on the web

Last, but not least all other bootstrap files needed to render the standalone html will be provided in the package.

The html/css/js will be cross-browser tested to work on evergreen browsers.

I look forward to getting feedback from the stakeholders 3 times a week until the November 4th deadline at mutually agreeable time slot to ensure we are building what the stakeholders want.
